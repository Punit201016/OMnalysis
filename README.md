# OMnalysis: An intergrated web application to visulaize and analyze differential quantitative data
OMnalysis is developed using R shiny, flexdashboard and bioconductor packages. This tool targets researchers who are new to RNA-seq technology and often depends on commercial vendors or core faciltiy to sequence and analyze their data. 

There are open source R packages such as DeSeq2 and edgeR that are extensively used to identify differentially expressed genes from the count data. The filtering of DEGs using FDR value or Fold change value is still the matter of discuss among the scientific community, therefore the young reseachers face difficulty to make actionable insight. OMnalysis uses the list of genes produced from edgeR with count per million normalization, significance value (P-value) and fold change value assigned to each lsit of gene over or under expressed in the treatments.

5.	After selecting the treatment user have to click on the **checkbox of plots** required to generate plots and table to visualize the each treatment data with converted ids.
6.	The output of the plots can be downloadable in four supporting image formats jpeg, png, pdf and tiff **using the drop-down format option**.

1.	Use the **ontology classes checkbox** to perform the categorical analysis of your expression data, either in the biological process (multiple molecular activities integrates to perform a process) or molecular function (activities at the molecular level by gene product) or cellular component (site of function concerning cellular structure).
2. 	**P-value cutoff** and the **q-value cutoff** are provided to obtain enriched test and significantly enriched test, respectively. The default p-value and q-value cutoff is 0 and can be adjusted to 0.01 and 0.05.
3.	The methods provided to perform **gene ontology enrichment analysis** are **over-represented analysis (ORA)**, (based on hypergeometric test and mapping of genes to the annotated biological vocabulary) and **gene set enrichment analysis** (GSEA), (based on the Kolmogorov Smirnov test and consider gene set with their log fold change value).

In the **drop-down pAadjust method tab** 7 adjustment methods Holm, Hochberg, Hommel,  Bonferroni,  Benjamini and Hochberg (BH),  Benjamini and Yekutieli (BY), FDR and none are provided to control false postive result. Above mentioned first four methods control the family-wise error rate (probability of making one or more false discoveries) and      remaining methods control the expected proportion of discoveries that are rejected falsely (FDR). We suggest FDR correction methods for a more reliable result.
7.	From the ontology result table, you need to provide one go term by selecting only one row and same GO term in all the treatments. This information will be used for the           visualization of heatmaps in the next **GO heatmaps panel**.
8.	These gene ontology result can be downloaded in CSV format by **clicking on treatment checkbox and Download button**.

# GO heatmaps
<img src = "https://github.com/Punit201016/OMnalysis/blob/main/www/om_6.PNG" height = "600" width = "800"> </img>

# Pathway enrichment analysis
<img src = "https://github.com/Punit201016/OMnalysis/blob/main/www/om_7.PNG" height = "600" width = "900"> </img>
1.	This section provides the databases and methods available to perform pathway analysis.
2.	The options provided are **over-represented analysis (ORA), (based on hypergeometric test), gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA), (based on the Kolmogorov Smirnov test), network topology analysis (NTA), ( uses genes, their expression value, and network arrangements (edges and nodes), Reactome pathway analysis uses Reactome database to perform pathway analysis.**
3.	The **default p-value cutoff is 0** and can be adjusted to get significant result, however, 0.05 p-value cutoff can be used as it is applied in the first filter to discard the non-significant gene set and then by removing **false positives result by applying pAdjust mehtod**. This stringency may result in a fewer number of gene set ranked.
4.	In enrichment analysis, gene sets are compared multiple times to the universal datasets and in each run it increases the chances of a false positive result, to overcome this problem multiple adjustment methods are provided.
5.	In the **drop-down pAadjust method tab** 7 adjustment methods Holm, Hochberg, Hommel,  Bonferroni,  Benjamini and Hochberg (BH),  Benjamini and Yekutieli (BY), FDR and to bypass these methods none is available. Above mentioned first four methods control the family-wise error rate (probability of making one or more false discoveries) and remaining methods control the expected proportion of discoveries that are rejected falsely (FDR). We suggest FDR correction methods for a more reliable result.
6. To support **NTA four database** are provided, **biocarta (protein sets participating in the pathway), panther (a curated and comprehensive database to classify protein and their genes through evolutionary relationship), NCI-Nature Pathway Interaction Database (Signaling pathways composed of human biomolecular interactions and cellular processes) and pharmgkb (a comprehensive resource that provides information about how human genetic variation affects the response to medications).**
7.	After providing the inputs, **click on the Go tab to launch the pathway enrichment analysis.** Please keep in mind that in each treatment, the same set of information will be used to **execute pathway enrichment analysis**. 
8.  To **perform pathway enrichment analysis in all treatments** you donâ€™t need to click and provide input each time, instead, you can click on the **subtabs Pathway result-2, Pathway result-3, and Pathway result-4" to execute analysis.**
9.	Pathway enrichment analysis section has **subtabs, Pathway result-1, Pathway result-2, Pathway result-3, and Pathway result-4.** Once the analysis completed a table of enrichment pathways will be displayed in the pathway subtabs.
10.	From the pathway analysis result table, you need to **select one same enriched pathway by selecting only one row in all treatments**. This information will be used for the visualization of the expressed gene in the next section enriched pathway visualization.
11.	These Pathway enrichment result can also be downloaded in **CSV format by clicking on treatment checkbox and Download button**.
